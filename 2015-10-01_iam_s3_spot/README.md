10/01 - IAM, S3 and Spot Instances
----------------------------------

In this talk we covered some basics of IAM, S3 (Simple Storage Service) and
some general tips for using Spot Instances.

You can check out the presentation slides, but unfortunately a large chunk of
my presentation is dedicated to live demos, and the slides themselves are light
in material. 

For the general topics of the talk (IAM, S3, Spot Instances), you can easily 
Google for more resources.

I've collected some random topics that were covered during the presentation
in links below.
