This repo contains materials for the cloud computing group in the Iowa State University Department of Statistics. I suggest that each meeting's materials, along with a README.md file, be in a folder named with that meeting's date's (yyyy-mm-dd).

The tentative schedule for future meetings is

- 9/17 - the Condo cluster (Will)
- 9/24 - AWS: spot instances and machine images (Will)
- 10/1 - AWS CodeDeploy (Xin)
- 10/8 - a "case study" in managing price in cloud computing (Xin)
- 10/15 - cloud computing finances in grants, etc. (Jarad)
