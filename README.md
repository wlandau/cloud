This repo contains materials for the cloud computing group in the Iowa State University Department of Statistics. I suggest that each meeting's materials, along with a README.md file, be in a folder whose name starts with that meeting's date's (yyyy-mm-dd).

There is a [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7RCnzSkNcQ&list=PLs5XGFlsJ8WiEdNPriu9nchQreNtwzPOe&index=2) of recordings of past meetings. 

The tentative schedule for future meetings is

- 9/24 - AWS: spot instances and machine images (Will)
- 10/1 - AWS CodeDeploy (Xin)
- 10/8 - a "case study" in managing price in cloud computing (Xin)
- 10/15 - cloud computing finances in grants, etc. (Jarad)
