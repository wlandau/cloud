# the Condo cluster

This meeting's focus is the Iowa State University Condo cluster. Basic access and usage is covered.

The actual materials aren't stored in this folder because there is already a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wlandau/condo) for that. Some useful links for Condo are below.

- The [Rmpi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpi/index.html) package
- The [pbdR](http://r-pbd.org/) packages
- [slides and examples at wlandau/condo on GitHub](https://github.com/wlandau/condo)
- The HPC group maintains a [script writer](http://hpcgroup.public.iastate.edu/HPC/hpc-class/hpc-class_script_writer.html)
to help us prepare jobs.
